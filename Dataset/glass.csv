"Very bad product","Terrible product..first of all the tempered glass had some sort of stain at the bottom and when you applied the glue and stuck the tempered glass screen protector.. the glue started to come out from all sides and some of the glue went into the speaker grill at the top... overall this was a very bad product","1.0"
"Best product at this price","Tempered glass is great cover full screen edge to edge fingerprint and touch works great but the amount ofglue they provide is more than required my suggestion will be to use half of the glue provided otherwise you will be wiping it from earpiece speaker but product is nice","5.0"

"Can harm your display","Beware from this type of product, it can kill your phone. I have experienced this. The glue chemical when react with uv light it may effect the display color and can cause other issues. In my case after applying this tempered glass my display colour was changed and after some time display touch stop working. I couldn't understand that what happened to my phone. I have taken my phone to the service centre where they informed that due to this type of chemical and the the heating process with uv light has affected the display and they also refused to replace the screen as this was not cover under the warranty. Service centre person told me that more than four to five such same cases are already in their knowledge who have faced same problem. So friends please be aware don't buy it, it is very dangerous if you are not sure then go to service centre and consult them, rest is your choice if you want to destroy your display which cost more than 18000 for just cheap product of 700 rupees then go for it","1.0"
"Amazing quality and amazing UV technology to fix the glass.","Amazing quality and amazing UV technology to fix the glass. Aftee applying glass i found there is no change on screen sensitivity and view quality , it is same as screen without glass . In past i used other glasses for my same mobile but no where i found perfection in quality which i found in this glass , Particularly following features are out standing in this glass with respect to other ordinary glass 1)  Air bubble free fixing by UV technology. 2)  You can align the glass  even after placing glass on screen with adhesive . 3)  Curvature/ edges  part is mad perfect and it is exactly matching with mobile  screen curvature . 4)  Everything is supplied in the kit , no need to search for any single item while fixing .

Finger print scanner works fine and the glass feels strong , not nano film it's like the usual tampered glass. Almost easy to install, the glue part can make it little messy but not difficult and it's easy to clean up. The pack comes with glass, glue , cleaners and light for the glue.","4.0"

"Pathetic - Horrible - Worst","Short and clear review (model OnePlus 7T Pro Mclaren) - product and it's related material seemed to be genuine and good - while following all it's instructions and video, the glass was fixed good enough *****BUT***** - The UV Glue came out from the edges, went into the phone's earpiece which got jamed - while keeping under the UV Light, the glue which had came out of the edges got converted into Solid state and got jammed on the side panel and curve edge of the screen - While removing the solid state of the glue which got jammed on the curve, it even removed a bit of black paint of my phone on the side panel right below alert slider (photo attached) which was Horrible - In the process of removing the solid state of glue, the screen glass also came out and it all got completely waste SO I ENDED UP LIKE THIS - jammed earpiece of the phone because of this glue - no glass on my phone screen because it got damaged while removing the solid glue which came out from the edges (after effect of the UV Light) - Phone's color was damaged because of this glue which got converted from the UV Light into solid state Conclusion: Please do not buy, glue will eventually come out and damage your phone color Which is 100% not acceptable AND check around the nearby mobile accessories shop where you'll find MATT finish screen guard fully transparent (no black frame borders) for OnePlus 7T Pro and also that will give your phone a premium look. But do not buy this one - or you'll regret later.","1.0"

"Great glass for op7 pro but be careful while installing","While the quality of tempered glass is good the loca or liquid adhesive is less so you need be perfect and not waste any. Plus THIS IS VERY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT HAPPEND TO ME MAKE SURE COVER YOUR PHONE INCALL EAR PIECE BEFORE APPLYING THE TEMPERED GLASS AND BEFORE PUTTING THE ADHESIVE. THE LIQUID ADHESIVE WILL GET INTO THE EAR PIECE AND YOU WILL NOY BE ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM IT IF YOU DOJT COVER IT DURING INSTALLATION. WISH THEY PROVIDED SOME SORT OF TAPE TO COVER IT PROPERLY","5.0"

It better you don't install it on you phone as the risk of phone screen getting damage is more.","1.0"
"Amazing and innovative tempered with beautiful technology","Was bit confused should I go for this new gel n uv based tempered. Finally purchased it. The packing was like it is not tempered some big gaget. So many things uv lights, glue, n tempered. The best part is it is one of the rare tempered that is covering full screen of one plus 7 pro. Initially I found myself confused how to apply on phone but through YouTube I learnt and it was very easy. Glue spread itself and just needed to use uv light for 30 seconds n it was done. No special art or knowledge needed to apply on phone. Thanks will purchase one piece more.","5.0"

It just broke within 2 weeks, surprisingly it never fall over anything. It has Very Very poor quality. I felt very bad that I paid 700 for this product and I can now confidently say that the tampered glass products available on road who charge you 100/ will work far better than this. I definitely don't recommend this to any others.","1.0"
"Poor fluid","While opening the adhesive fluid some plastic partical came out on the screen with liquid. Hence it was wastage . Can't expect such a brand is doing packing like this . And all money is lost . Now able to install .","1.0"
"Worst product ever","This is the worst screen guard I have ever seen or had for any mobile phone. It is very complicated to apply, requring you to first put a glue on the screen. I followed the instructions 100% as shown on the video, the problem is that unlike what you see on the video, once you put the glue on the center of the screen and align the guard over the screen, upon placing it on top of the glue, the guard keeps sliding up and down, after much effort I was able to stabalize it, but the glue did not spread as shown in the video and left so many air bubbles on the screen. The UV light stick did not help in drying out or getting the bubbles out. Don't waist your money, this product is not returnable.","1.0"
"Pathetic.... Or if there is any word lower than pathetic","This is a pathetic product and not user friendly....even an expert will find difficult to install.... The liquid glue is difficult to control and always leaves bubbles... Utter waste of money.... Would requests a refund... I bought twice thinking the first time I installed incorrectly.... But it's the same issue even after following all the instructions to the tee.... Storngly reccommend not to buy this overrated highly expensive dirt of a product....","1.0"
"costly - somewhat overpriced","The screen guard is fairly easy to apply if you follow the directions (see youtube videos for detailed instructions). I spilled some of the glue that came with it and now have a little bit of air bubble stuck at the bottom part. But the screen guard is of excellent quality. The fingerprint reader works just fine with this. Cost is a bit disapointing in my frank opinion, but when you're buying a phone worth ~ 50k, this is a good enough investment (this is the consolation that I give myself). P.S. The UV light works well with power banks also.","5.0"
"Good adhesion; Sturdy product; just not easy to apply","I received a broken glass but they replaced it very fast. Very nice of them. - The adhesion is really good - the parts inside the box are well organised and the packing is well done, presentation is well done - it's not easy to apply. the glue gets all over the phone (after applying the glass) and there are still bubbles on the screen even after trying it two times. I've written a review before and I was asked to remove it via a call from the manufacturer (they removed this product and re-released it, so my review is based on a previous generation). However, I'm not going to delete this one, and I'll stand by my review.","3.0"

"Tricky but works.","Okay, so you are here to buy a tempered for your curved one plus 7 pro, the curved screens are tricky ones. I had one note 9 and i bought tempered worth 900Rs which just went into waste because it didn't had enough glue on edges. Now when you've come here you see around 20 percent of 1 star rating and 50 percent of 5 star rating, you are confused now. I bet 15 percent of those 20 percent people messed up with something, some had installed it on a table precious to them and the glue doesn't come off and most obvious some complain about glue going in speaker grill. But, I am going to say this, if you are really carefull and you do not do any mistakes, this case is good to go. Maybe you can learn from those 20 percent and do not repeat their mistskes, like cover you speaker grill with a tape(use to outer tape of package an stick it on the grill, just the grill and the whole rest to the back of phone. Do not perform the procedure on a table where you don't want glue to fall. Do not perform it in direct sunlight, make sure your ultra voilet light is attached with power bank and it glows. Place all the glue in the center, placw the tempered using two holding sticker which comes in the box, let the glue goes everywhere, especially in the edges(that's what this tempered is different from regular ones, glue flows in the same shape how you put the tempered on, and it covers and do not keep any empty air bubble), clean the glue which comes out of the protector glass(i messed this one in the corner but it still is fine) and then thoroughly apply UV light till a minute or two. My screen work fine without any crack on tempered in one day of usage, I will update if something bad goes off. In conclusion, you can totally go with this screen protector just make sure to do it right.","5.0"
"It's Crap! Not worth the money!","i've been CaseU screen guards for a while with my phones. They are expensive than other alternatives but the quality is usually good. However, I recently purchased OnePlus 7T Pro which has a curved screen and ordered this guard. Let me tell you - the application process is a nightmare. You have to control the spread of glue very carefully otherwise the glue most certainly comes out from all edges and goes into the speaker and spoils it. I've managed to save the speaker. I watched the youtube tutorial and follow all the instructions to the T. They say don't apply pressure and let it do it's job, so I did and didn't try to apply pressure. The glue quickly spread across the screen and I used the UV lamp for about 20 minutes to stick it throughly. Eventually, after the fluid dried off, it left a few air bubbles in the middle of the screen. I thought they'd go with time but they didn't. But within 15 days only, the edges started getting weird looking air bubbles, that increased and started looking like crap. You can see the edges in the images. And this is only increasing. I was using the cover that comes with the phone, so I thought the edges are coming off may be due to that cover. So I removed it so it'd stop but didn't matter. The package comes with a few instructions to mail if there's any issue, which I did but they asked for images, that I shared and haven't got any response on that for over a week. They couldn't care less. I wouldn't spend about 700-800 bucks on this piece of crap if I were you.","1.0"
"Stop looking for anything else","This is handsdown the best screen protector for the price. It's super smooth. Installation is actually easy considering they give you everything you might need. U just have to be super patient. And the screen protector itself is very very thin. Can't comment on durability Just yet. Caution: wipe the overflowing liquid as soon as possible. It can be easily cleaned. And wait for the glue to get curated. Till it's not, the screen protector moves around a bit.","5.0"
"Best glass for oneplus 7 pro","This product is so good beacuse i also try another oneplus 7 pro tempered glass but another tempered glass is not work but this glass is so best and finger print reader is so good working and glass is also good and screen clearity is amazing beacuse this tempered glass is clear with no border line this thing is awesome and this tempered glass easily applied with no bubbles.this tempered is so good i am very happy.","5.0"
"Not Worth the Price and Pathetic Seller!!","This curved tempered glass is one of the many glasses I have tried for my latest mobile and also for other old mobiles. Though the price was on a little higher side, I wanted to try this and was happy after applying this on my mobile. Installation was easy and the glass sits good on the screen without any bubbles. I thought I made good choice buying this one and was happy for 3-4 days. The edges started developing gaps after 3-4 days. You can see the images attached. And after 2 weeks, when I was trying to change my mobile case and accidentally the tempered glass got lifted. Thats it, it wont sit back normally. There are so many bubbles left. Atleast the traditional tempered glass will not form bubbles like that after you remove and put it back. And the way how seller responds to you is really pathetic.","1.0"

"Perfect product for the best price.","Size is perfect and no black border strip . Most other tempered glasses have black border which covers the display. Also, the procedure of applying tempered glass using liquid adhesive and then clearing with UV light is better, it leaves no chance of bubbles which can be left in case of a normal tempered glass. Tried this tempered glass after using 2 different products, which not only left bubbles, but they weren't of proper size also.","5.0"
"Waste of Money.","It sticks to your screen based upon your luck. I don't advise to go for it. Inspite of following the instructions carefully the adhesive will not stick properly.

I had sent them many messages but of no use. Pathetic Product & Service","1.0"
"Great product, but not easy to install","The product is great, as advertised nice clean and responsive and edge to edge cover but installation is not that easy, one small mistake and the tempered glass is unusable.

Step X: Place your phone in horizontal surface after the cleaning procedure. Very important as glue should be at the center for the best results.","5.0"

"IMPORTANT","IMPORTANT: pointing this out due to experience!! I have followed the instructions as given on the product.
