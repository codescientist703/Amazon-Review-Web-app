"Value For Money !! Go for it","Update (15/08/2020): Never give a chance to regret..  Go ahead...üëç The Icons looks was not so great ..  And then I set 'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ... Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning üôÇ )..  So I turned off fast charging option.. You can do that.. Its will not affect  battery MONSTER : 1. Battery :- 5/5 Two day battery standby for normal easy 2.Display:- 4.99/5 Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display 3.Design:3/5 It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers 4. Camera: 3/5 Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available.. 5. OS&UI:- 5/5 Android 10 with One UI 6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast 7.Processor and performance 3.5/5 Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated.. 8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone 9. Accessories : 2/5 No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches.. 10.Loud speaker 1.5/5 Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones) Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer  ...","4.0"

"Battery life is not upto mark","I am writing my review after using it for 6 days .I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims. Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.","3.0"
